# Phase 3: Add Codex Support

## Goal

Expand esperkit from Claude-only to support Codex workflows while preserving the existing project structure and phase-based delivery model.

## In Scope

- Define Codex-compatible command flow for init, planning, implementation, and shipping
- Add install targets for Codex assets alongside existing Claude skills
- Update docs and templates to cover both Claude and Codex usage
- Add tests for provider-aware CLI behavior

## Out of Scope (deferred)

- Removing Claude support
- Multi-agent orchestration across providers
- Hosted dashboard or remote control plane

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `esperkit` installs artifacts required for Codex in addition to Claude
- [x] Existing Claude workflows remain backward compatible
- [x] README documents setup and end-to-end flow for Codex users
- [x] Tests cover provider-aware install and command behavior

## Phase Notes

Phase 2 delivered CLI primitives (`config`, `plan`, `backlog`) and consolidated plan/file operations. Phase 3 should reuse those primitives so Codex support is mostly adapter and packaging work, not a redesign.

## Shipped Plans
- #019 — Add Codex support across installer, assets, and docs: Define provider model and install targets. Files: cli.js, README.md, package.json, cli.test.js, config.test.js
- #020 — fix: skill files reference `esper` instead of `esperkit` for CLI commands: In each SKILL.md file, replace all backtick-wrapped and code-block CLI command references from `esper <subcommand>` to `esperkit <subcommand>`. Files: SKILL.md (all 10 skill directories)
